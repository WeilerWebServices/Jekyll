title: jekyll-picture-tag
description: >
  Liquid tag that adds responsive images to your Jekyll static site. It follows the [picture element](http://picture.responsiveimages.org/) pattern, and polyfills older browsers with [Picturefill](https://github.com/scottjehl/picturefill). Jekyll Picture Tag automatically creates resized source images, is fully configurable, and covers all use cases — including art direction and resolution switching — with a little YAML configuration and a simple template tag.
